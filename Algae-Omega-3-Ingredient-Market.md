Furthermore, the increased focus on heart health, cognitive function, and overall wellness among consumers is contributing to the market's growth.</p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p>With the shift towards sustainable ingredients, algae omega-3 offers a renewable and eco-friendly alternative to traditional fish-derived omega-3 sources. This market has witnessed a surge in investments, particularly in regions like North America and Europe, where consumers are more health-conscious and environmentally aware. Algae omega-3 is also increasingly being integrated into dietary supplements, functional foods, and beverages. Additionally, companies are leveraging innovations in algae cultivation methods, making the production process more cost-effective and scalable. Regulatory bodies, such as the FDA and EFSA, have further supported the market's growth by approving the use of algae-derived omega-3 in food and beverages, which is expected to fuel market expansion in the coming years.
